        </div>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p><strong>Factory Production</strong></p>
          <p>
            In the factory, products are manufactured and uniquely identified by
            serial numbers for tracking purposes. For example, each can of oil
            receives a serial number. Once produced, cans are grouped into
            boxes, which are also assigned unique serial numbers. These boxes
            may then be consolidated into larger units, or pallets, each of
            which is similarly identified by a unique serial number. Prior to
            leaving the factory, products undergo thorough Quality Control (QC)
            checks, where they are scanned and labeled as either “QC Pass” or
            “QC Fail” to ensure only high-quality products proceed to the next
            stage.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><strong>Warehouse Management System</strong></p>
          <p>
            Upon completion of production, products are transferred to
            designated warehouses across various regions. In the inbound
            process, each product is scanned to verify authenticity and count.
            Products are then organized within the warehouse according to
            designated storage areas called "lines," which contain multiple
            racks. Internal transfers within the warehouse, referred to as
            "Intra-Warehouse Transfers," allow for efficient movement and
            storage. Inventory and stock checks are conducted regularly, and any
            defective products identified are flagged in the system as
            unsellable. Approved products are prepared for dispatch to retail
            outlets, where they undergo an outbound process, including final
            scans to ensure accuracy.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><strong>Sales Order & Delivery Order</strong></p>
          <p>
            Once products are stocked in warehouses, they are ready for
            distribution to retail outlets. Sales representatives visit these
            outlets to manage sales orders, which are supported by a robust
            tracking system that includes journey planning, promotions,
            invoicing, and documentation. After a sales order is confirmed,
            products are released from the warehouse in a "Delivery Order"
            process, ensuring that items are delivered promptly to the intended
            outlets.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><strong>Point of Sale (POS) & Loyalty System</strong></p>
          <p>
            Upon receiving products, outlets can begin selling them to
            customers. Each product is scanned at the point of sale to confirm
            its serial number, allowing outlets to track sales through the POS
            system. Additionally, a loyalty program enables customers to earn
            points with each purchase. Accumulated points can be redeemed for
            available rewards, such as gifts or vouchers, creating a rewarding
            experience for loyal customers.
